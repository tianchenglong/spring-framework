= `@TestBean`

`@TestBean` is used on a field in a test class to override a specific bean in the test's
`ApplicationContext` with an instance provided by a factory method.

The associated factory method name is derived from the annotated field's name, or the
bean name if specified. The factory method must be `static`, accept no arguments, and
have a return type compatible with the type of the bean to override. To make things more
explicit, or if you'd rather use a different name, the annotation allows for a specific
method name to be provided.

By default, the annotated field's type is used to search for candidate bean definitions
to override. If multiple candidates match, `@Qualifier` can be provided to narrow the
candidate to override. Alternatively, a candidate whose bean definition name matches the
name of the field will match.

To use a by-name override rather than a by-type override, specify the `name` attribute
of the annotation.

[WARNING]
====
Qualifiers, including the name of the field, are used to determine if a separate
`ApplicationContext` needs to be created. If you are using this feature to override the
same bean in several tests, make sure to name the field consistently to avoid creating
unnecessary contexts.
====

The following example shows how to use the default behavior of the `@TestBean` annotation:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	class OverrideBeanTests {
		@TestBean // <1>
		private CustomService customService;

		// test case body...

		private static CustomService customService() { // <2>
			return new MyFakeCustomService();
		}
	}
----
<1> Mark a field for overriding the bean with type `CustomService`.
<2> The result of this static method will be used as the instance and injected into the field.
======

In the example above, we are overriding the bean with type `CustomService`. If more than
one bean of that type exists, the bean named `customService` is considered. Otherwise,
the test will fail, and you will need to provide a qualifier of some sort to identify
which of the `CustomService` beans you want to override.

The following example uses a by-name lookup, rather than a by-type lookup:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	class OverrideBeanTests {
		@TestBean(name = "service", methodName = "createCustomService") // <1>
		private CustomService customService;

		// test case body...

		private static CustomService createCustomService() { // <2>
			return new MyFakeCustomService();
		}
	}
----
<1> Mark a field for overriding the bean with name `service`, and specify that the
    factory method is named `createCustomService`.
<2> The result of this static method will be used as the instance and injected into the field.
======

[NOTE]
====
Spring searches for the factory method to invoke in the test class, in the test class
hierarchy, and in the enclosing class hierarchy for a `@Nested` test class.

Alternatively, a factory method in an external class can be referenced via its
fully-qualified method name following the syntax `<fully-qualified class name>#<method name>`
â€“ for example, `methodName = "org.example.TestUtils#createCustomService"`.
