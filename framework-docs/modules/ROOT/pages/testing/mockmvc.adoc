:page-section-summary-toc: 1

MockMvc provides support for testing Spring MVC applications. It performs full Spring MVC
request handling but via mock request and response objects instead of a running server.

MockMvc can be used on its own to perform requests and verify responses responses using
Hamcrest, or through `MockMvcTester` that provides a fluent API using AssertJ. Finally,
it can also be used through the xref:testing/webtestclient.adoc[WebTestClient] where
MockMvc is plugged in as the server to handle requests with. The advantage of
`WebTestClient` is the option to work with higher level objects instead of raw data as
well as the ability to switch to full, end-to-end HTTP tests against a live server and
use the same test API.
